# Learning Environment Constraints in Collaborative Robotics: A Decentralized Leader-Follower Approach

Collaborative manipulation in unknown environments with implicit communication and a leader-follower hierarchy. Codes yield the results of https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.04460.

The red dot denotes the leader and the blue dot is the follower. The red star is the goal position of the initially chosen leader. The simulation shows a successful transportation task completion with multiple leader-follower role switches. The red crosses denote the directly sensed obstacle points by the leader and the blue crosses denote the inferred obstacle points by the leader via follower's reactive feedback (i.e., indirect sensing).
